                  <h2>If We Were In an Elevator… This Would Be My Pitch!</h2>
                  Hello, my name is Andy! I have just recently graduated from
                  the Web Development and Internet Applications Fundamentals
                  program at Conestoga College. I have a deep interest in web
                  design and development. I enjoy being creative and creating
                  new content. I had just graduated at the end of April, and I
                  am currently searching for opportunities as a Web
                  Developer/Designer<br /><br />

                  <h2>Who I Am...</h2>
                  I am an individual who loves creating, coding, and Cooking! My
                  previous career was that of a Head Chef at a Café and Lounge
                  for 7 years. When Covid 19 reared its ugly head, my
                  establishment was unfortunately shut down for an extended
                  time. Eventually, my team and myself were relieved from our
                  positions and the Café had closed its doors. I took this as an
                  opportunity to explore new and old passions and I soon found
                  myself gravitating to an old hobby that I had many years ago;
                  creating web pages! After enjoying a boot camp paired with
                  LinkedIn Learning, I had decided that I wanted to jump back
                  into the game. This decision led me to enroll in college to
                  learn the ins and outs of Web Development. I may be newer to a
                  few of the concepts being taught these days, but I’m no
                  stranger to designing. I have some previous experience in
                  Graphic Design from a college course that I was enrolled in
                  back in 2002. A couple of years before this, I had also
                  enjoyed dabbling in HTML and creating hobby sites. I have seen
                  that a lot has changed since my original HTML days. CSS and
                  JavaScript were new to me, but I quickly caught on!<br /><br />

                <article class="mySlides">
                  <h2>What I Do...</h2>
                  I was very excited to see how the industry had progressed
                  since those days. I had begun learning better HTML practices,
                  as well as CSS, and JavaScript. These are the Front-End
                  languages that had been taught to us during my schooling. I
                  have learned to write well-organized and efficient HTML and
                  CSS. JavaScript was new to me. It was something that I had not
                  learned or even thought about before I reignited my interest
                  in creating web pages. It was difficult to understand at
                  first, but after spending many hours working on school
                  assignments and seeking additional resources through Udemy and
                  LinkedIn Learning, I am more comfortable with it now. As for
                  Back-End languages that I have studied, this would include PHP
                  and MySQL. I also have been taught how to use WordPress as a
                  CMS, which I find very interesting, and would enjoy finding
                  employment utilizing WordPress.<br /><br />

                  <h2>What I'm Looking For...</h2>
                  Ultimately my goal is to find employment as a Web
                  Developer/Designer or WordPress Developer. I am interested in
                  UI/UX roles as well. I am very eager to learn new design
                  principles and technologies. I am a naturally creative person.
                  I have always been interested in designing, creating content,
                  and tailoring it to the user experience. I possess a great
                  imagination and a keen eye for detail. In my previous Culinary
                  career attention to detail, creativity, and working towards
                  deadlines were a daily occurrence. These concepts became
                  second nature to me. I would feel very fulfilled to be able to
                  acquire employment that allows me to make use of my creativity
                  and skills<br /><br />

              This was a very fun project for me. I took a few mini projects and
              tied them all into one. Here we use a Weather API, and Quote
              Generator API. I have added a To-DO List and functional Calendar
              with JS. I have also included a Music Station that loads
              (previously chosen) music playlists. It is a one-stop-shop for
              when you initially load your browser!<br /><br />

              Hey, gotta start somewhere! This is a Weather Finder App that
              utilizes the Open Weather Map API. You will see that I had added
              the extra details for the highs and lows of the day as well as
              humidity, wind, and the appropriate weather icon. The current date

              them and their families create budget-friendly meals, learn
              culinary techniques, and provide additional information. If this
              was a site that would be maintained regularly, new recipes would

              With this project, I utilized HTML, CSS, PHP, and MySQL to create
              the site. I also used Adobe Illustrator to create all the vector
              images. The user can visit the site to view the menu which is
              categorized by heat level. They can also make a purchase of the
              hot sauces from the product page. I used PHP and MySQL to allow
              the user to add items to their cart. The PHP stops the user from
              ordering more than is in the inventory and on the following pages,
              updates the inventory from the purchase, creates a guest user
              account and adds the entire order to an order table in the
              database.<br /><br />
